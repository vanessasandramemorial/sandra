/**
 * Pages carrying a Turnstile widget, which must be reached by a full page load.
 *
 * Turnstile's implicit rendering scans the DOM for `.cf-turnstile` once, when
 * its script executes. Next loads a `<Script>` exactly once per session — "even
 * if a user navigates between multiple routes", per its own docs — so after a
 * client-side navigation the script is already loaded, never runs again, and
 * never scans. The new page gets a widget container that nothing will ever fill:
 * `window.turnstile` is defined, no widget appears, no token is ever produced,
 * and the form says "please complete the verification below" over empty space.
 *
 * That was reported as intermittent for months. It isn't: arriving by link fails
 * every time, arriving by reload works every time. Confirmed from the telemetry
 * too — `turnstile:ready:script=true` with no token is precisely this shape.
 *
 * A plain <a> forces a document load, so the script re-executes and scans. The
 * cost is one slower navigation on three pages; the alternative is a form that
 * cannot be submitted. **Do not turn these back into <Link>.**
